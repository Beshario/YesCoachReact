# YesCoach MVP Phase 1: Pragmatic Implementation Plan

## Overview
A commercially viable 10-week MVP that proves the body map concept while planting seeds for future intelligence.

## Core Philosophy
**"Simple now, smart later"** - Build a working product that users love, with architecture that can evolve into the biomechanical vision.

---

## Phase 1 MVP Scope (10 Weeks)

### What We're Building
1. **Interactive Body Map** (The Innovation)
   - 2-layer SVG navigation
   - 20 major muscle groups
   - Visual muscle selection

2. **Exercise Database** (The Foundation)
   - 150-200 exercises from free-exercise-db
   - Simple muscle mappings (Primary/Secondary)
   - Basic filtering and search

3. **Smart-ish Features** (The Differentiator)
   - Pre-computed "activation levels" (High/Medium/Low)
   - Basic exercise relationships via tags
   - Simple fatigue tracking (Red/Yellow/Green)

### What We're NOT Building (Yet)
- Real-time biomechanical calculations
- Complex activation formulas
- Machine learning
- Detailed progress analytics
- Social features

---

## Data Architecture (Simplified)

### Exercise Data Model
```typescript
interface SimpleExercise {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  
  // From free-exercise-db
  category: string;
  equipment: string[];
  primaryMuscles: number[];  // Muscle IDs
  secondaryMuscles: number[];
  
  // Our additions (pre-computed)
  activationLevels: {
    [muscleId: number]: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  };
  
  // Simple categorization for relationships
  tags: string[];  // ['compound', 'push', 'upper', 'strength']
  difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  
  // Instructions
  instructions: string[];
  tips?: string[];
}
```

### Muscle State (Ultra Simple)
```typescript
interface SimpleMuscleState {
  muscleId: number;
  lastWorked: Date;
  status: 'fresh' | 'worked' | 'fatigued';  // Green/Yellow/Red
  workoutCount: number;  // This week
}
```

### Pre-computed Relationships
```typescript
interface ExerciseRelations {
  exerciseId: string;
  similar: string[];      // Same muscles, different equipment
  alternatives: string[]; // Different muscles, same movement pattern
  progressions: string[]; // Harder version
  regressions: string[];  // Easier version
}
```

## Technical Shortcuts (Smart Compromises)

### 1. Pre-compute Everything
```javascript
// During build/import process
exercises.forEach(exercise => {
  // Simple activation levels
  exercise.activationLevels = {
    [primaryMuscle]: 'high',
    [secondaryMuscle]: 'medium',
    [stabilizer]: 'low'
  };
  
  // Basic relationships
  exercise.similar = findSimilar(exercise);
  exercise.alternatives = findAlternatives(exercise);
});
```

### 2. Tag-Based Intelligence
```javascript
// Use tags for quick relationships
const tags = [
  'compound', 'isolation',
  'push', 'pull',
  'upper', 'lower', 'core',
  'strength', 'endurance',
  'barbell', 'dumbbell', 'bodyweight'
];

// Find alternatives by matching tags
function findAlternatives(exercise) {
  return exercises.filter(e => 
    e.tags.includes(exercise.tags[0]) &&  // Same movement
    e.equipment !== exercise.equipment     // Different equipment
  );
}
```

### 3. Simple Muscle Fatigue
```javascript
// No complex calculations, just time-based
function getMuscleStatus(lastWorked) {
  const hoursSince = (Date.now() - lastWorked) / (1000 * 60 * 60);
  
  if (hoursSince < 24) return 'fatigued';    // Red
  if (hoursSince < 48) return 'worked';      // Yellow
  return 'fresh';                             // Green
}
```

## Data Sources & Legal Safety

### Using free-exercise-db
- Open source exercise database
- Modify descriptions for uniqueness
- Add your own categorization layer
- Focus value on UI/UX, not data

### Future-Proofing
Store data in a format that can evolve:
```typescript
interface FutureProofExercise {
  // Current simple data
  staticData: SimpleExercise;
  
  // Placeholder for future
  biomechanics?: {
    version: string;
    calculations: any;
  };
  
  // Room for ML predictions
  predictions?: {
    version: string;
    model: string;
    outputs: any;
  };
}
```

## User Journey (MVP)

1. **Open App** → See body map with muscle groups
2. **Tap Muscle** → See exercises for that muscle
3. **Browse Exercises** → Filter by equipment I have
4. **View Exercise** → See instructions and which muscles it works
5. **Log Workout** → Mark exercises as done
6. **See Progress** → Visual feedback on body map

Simple. Intuitive. Valuable.

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Simple Solution |
|------|----------------|
| Exercise data accuracy | Use established free-exercise-db, verify top 50 exercises |
| Performance issues | Pre-compute everything, lazy load images |
| User complexity | Progressive disclosure, great onboarding |
| Differentiation | Focus on body map UX, not exercise data |

---

## Key Decisions

### Why This Approach Works
1. **Proves Core Concept**: Body map navigation
2. **Real User Value**: Visual muscle tracking
3. **Technical Feasibility**: 10 weeks with small team
4. **Future Potential**: Architecture can evolve
5. **Low Risk**: Uses proven data, innovates on UX

### What Makes It Different (Even Simple)
- **Visual First**: Body map vs text lists
- **Muscle Centric**: Not just exercise lists
- **Smart Defaults**: Pre-computed relationships
- **Mobile Native**: Built for phones, not adapted

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. Set up free-exercise-db import pipeline
2. Create muscle mapping spreadsheet
3. Design tag taxonomy
4. Build data processing scripts

### Quick Wins
- Get body map working with mock data
- Test on 5 real users
- Validate exercise selection flow
- Measure time to find exercises

### Reality Checks
- [ ] Can grandma use it?
- [ ] Does it work on a 3-year-old Android?
- [ ] Can you explain it in one sentence?
- [ ] Would you use it at the gym?
