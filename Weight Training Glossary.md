Exercise Classification
Basic

A principal exercise that can place greater absolute intensity on muscles exercised relative to auxiliary exercises. Basic exercises tend to have more of the following characteristics:

gravity dependent
inclusion or shift of resistance through multiple muscle group throughout the range of motion
e.g. bench press: front deltoid to pectoralis major to triceps
natural transfer of torsion force to compression force (e.g., lockout on squat, bench press, etc.) or tension force (e.g. extension of arm curl) to the bone(s) and joint(s) during full range of motion
Also see angle of pull
Barbell Lunge

Auxiliary

An optional exercise that may supplement a basic exercise. Auxiliary exercises may place greater relative intensity on a specific muscle or a head of a muscle. The classification of a weight training exercise as Basic or Auxilliary can depend on the context of other exercises. Therefore the same exercise can serve as a basic exercise in one program whereas it could be an auxiliary exercise in another program. Auxiliary exercises are also known as an accessory lifts.

Compound

An exercise that involves two or more simultaneously joint movements.
Isolated

An exercise that involves just one discernible joint movement.
Weight Training Exercise Classification	Utility
Basic	Auxiliary
Mechanics	Compound	Many	Some
Isolated	Some	Many
Closed Chain

An exercise or movement in which the end segment of the exercised limb is fixed, or the end is supporting the weight. Most compound exercises are closed-chainmovements.

Open Chain

An exercise or movement in which the end segment of the exercised limb is not fixed, or the end is not supporting the weight. Many isolated exercises are open-chain movements.

Functional

An exercise which allows one to gain motor development or strength in a manner in which it is used in the execution of a particular task (eg: specific sport skill, occupational task, or daily activity).

Push

Movement away from center of body during the concentric contraction of the target muscle. Isolated movements are classified by their compound counterparts.

Pull

Movement toward center of body during the concentric contraction of the target muscle. Isolated movements are classified by their compound counterparts.

Set, Reps, Workload Shorthand

Sets x Rep Range
2 x 8-12
Sets x Reps x Resistance
2 x 10 x 120 kg
Sets x Relative Workload
2 x 80% 1RM
Intensity (I)

The amount of weight used, percentage of one repetition maximum, or the effort used during the exercise. Also see Aerobic Intensity.

Frequency (F)

The number of workouts per week (or unit time) or number times a muscle group is trained per week (or unit time). Also see Aerobic Frequency.

Duration (D)

The time from the beginning to the end of the workout. Duration may also describe other time components such time under tension or Volume (see below). Also see Aerobic Duration.

Volume (V)

Total amount of work performed in a training phase (workout,

week, month, etc). Methods of calculating include:

number of repetitions or sets performed in a workout
product of resistance and repetitions (eg: 10 reps * 45 kg = 450 kg)
total work (eg: 445 N * 1 m * 10 reps = 4450 J)
Also see Aerobic Volume.

Handstand Shoulder Press (between benches)

Rest Between Sets and Exercises

Influences energy recovery and training adaptations.

Repetition Velocity

Speed of repetition, cadence, or time under tension

Tempo Training Shorthand(seconds)

2 point tempo
Eccentric / Concentric
Example: 3/2
3 point tempo
Example: 3/0/2
Eccentric / Stretched / Concentric
4 point tempo
Example: 3/0/2/1
Eccentric / Stretched / Concentric / Contracted

Hypertrophy

An increase in muscle size

Hyperplasia

An increase in muscle cell number
